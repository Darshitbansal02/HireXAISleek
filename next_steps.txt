I have checked `next.config.ts`, and it does not contain any custom configurations that would interfere with CSS.

Since the CSS is still not visible, let's try a more aggressive approach to clear any potential caching issues:

1.  **Clear your browser cache:** Perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) or clear your browser's cache entirely.
2.  **Delete the `.next` directory:** Stop your development server, then delete the `.next` folder in your project's root directory. This will force Next.js to rebuild everything from scratch. You can do this by running `rm -rf .next` in your terminal (or `rd /s /q .next` on Windows).
3.  **Restart the development server:** After deleting `.next`, run `npm run dev` again.

Please try these steps and let me know if the CSS is now visible. If not, I will need you to inspect your browser's developer tools (console and network tabs) and report any errors or failed requests related to CSS files.
